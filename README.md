Application description:
 
It is a dice roll and helps users decide what to eat for dinner or lunch applications. 
We set the barrier maximum with $30 with food. So, the dice has 6 sides and each one represents different colors and refers to different cuisine.

Filter Function:

The filter function enables users to roll a virtual dice to randomly decide what to eat.
